# Classes and Objects

In real world, we can find many objects around us. ll these objects have some state and behavior. If we consider a car, then its states are **name**, **speed**, and **fuel**, and the behavior is **refuel**, **drive**, and **park.**
### Defination:
1. Class is a set of object which shares common characteristics/ behavior and common properties/ attributes.  
2. Class is not a real world entity. It is just a template or blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.  
3. Class does not occupy memory.
